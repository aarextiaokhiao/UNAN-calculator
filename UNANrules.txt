Here are rules of UNAN:

a[0]b = a*b
a[x]1 = a
a[n+1]b+1 = a[n]a[n+1]b
a[x,0]b = a[x]b

Some terms used:

The base is the first number, before the brackets.
The iterator is the last number, after the brackets.

If the array starts with 0, follow the process below:

Case A: If the entry is a 0, move to the next entry
Case B: If the entry is higher than 0, then decrease it by 1 and change the previous entry to the iterator. Set the iterator to the base. The process ends.
